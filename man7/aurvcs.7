.SH NAME
aurvcs \- workflows for VCS packages
.
.SH DESCRIPTION
Workflows for building and managing VCS packages.
.
.SH aur\-sync\-devel
Takes the contents of a local repository
.RB ( "aur\-repo \-\-list" )
and matches them against a common pattern for VCS packages
.RB ( "grep \-E $AURVCS" ).
It then looks in the
.BR aur\-sync (1)
cache
.RB ( "find $AURDEST" )
for relevant directories.
.PP
Any existing
.BR PKGBUILD (5)
files in these directories are executed, with upstream sources updated
to their latest revision.
.RB ( aur\-srcver
using
.BR "makepkg \-o" ).
.PP
Any option arguments are forwarded to
.BR aur\-repo (1).

    # Pull any new AUR revisions (e.g. dependency updates) for VCS packages 
    # and inspect them with aur-view(1). This is done before running aur\-srcver,
    # which runs makepkg and sources the PKGBUILD.
    cd "$AURDEST"
    aur fetch \- <"$tmp"/vcs
    aur view \-a "$tmp"/vcs

    # Find VCS packages that are outdated according to aur\-srcver.
    # This checks out the latest revision for existing source directories,
    # assuming the PKGBUILD has been viewed priorly.
    aur vercmp \-p <(get_latest_revision <"$tmp"/vcs) <"$tmp"/db >"$tmp"/outdated

    # Finally, build the packages.

.SS Notes
In the penultimate line, the resulting package versions
.RB ( "get_latest_revision" )
are compared against the local repository
.RB ( "aur repo \-\-list" ).
If the package version is newer, it is built with
.BR aur\-build (1).
.PP
Version-control packages typically have
.B pkgver
set to the upstream revision at the time of package submission, making
the AUR-advertised version older than the latest version.
