.SH NAME
aurhosting \- host pacman repositories using git
.
.SH ADVANTAGES
.SS Atomic changesets
.
Each revision can be viewed as a single set of packages. This provides
a way for every commit to be an atomic operation allowing for mirrors
to synchronize consistently. Each mirror can then make a shallow
clone of the repository while still only recovering changed packages
reducing bandwidth while maintaining atomicity without additional
scripting or tooling.
.
.SS Changeset based roll back
.
Rolling back using changesets is usually done by specifying the commit
checksum in the Server directive and allows for rolling back based on
changesets rather than needing to manage finely grained version
dependencies.
.
.SH DISADVANTAGES
.SS Requires raw file access
.
The server hosting the git repository needs a mechanism to expose raw
files directly using a simple and consistent layout so that files can
be downloaded using dead reckoning.
